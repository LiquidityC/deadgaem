flat2d:
	-	Revert to old horizontal-move-and-collide followed by vertical-move-and-collide in collision
		engine. Not worth the time to debug and sort out the sweeping. I can look more at that later. I will
		keep the implementation just not use that method for the time being.
	-	Might need to make different collision types (materials) once collision engine works.
		Mainly elastic, semi-elastic, inelastic (translates to bounce, stick to or slide along/off walls).
		These are explained in link above.

Game:
	-	Make the initial level once collisions are smoother.
