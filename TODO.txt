flat2d:
	-	Drop the GameObject, it can be replaced by RenderedGameObject.
		Perhaps rename it Entity?
	-	Make collision detection a separate game loop and don't check it
		when moving the actual object. Collisions should run after preRender()
		and before render().

Game:
	-	Make the initial level once collisions are smoother.
