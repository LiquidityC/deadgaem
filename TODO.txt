flat2d:
	-	Move collsion box to the EntityProperties for later use in the better
		collision detection engine.
	-	Make collision detection a separate game loop and don't check it
		when moving the actual object. Collisions should run after preRender()
		and before render().
		This is the plan: http://blog.5pmcasual.com/game-controller-api-in-sdl2.html
	-	Might need to make different collision types (materials) once collision engine works.
		Mainly elastic, semi-elastic, inelastic (translates to bounce, stick to or slide along/off walls).
		These are explained in link above.

Game:
	-	Make the initial level once collisions are smoother.
