flat2d:
	-	Make collision detection a separate game loop and don't check it
		when moving the actual object. Collisions should run after preRender()
		and before render().
		This is the plan: http://blog.5pmcasual.com/game-controller-api-in-sdl2.html

Game:
	-	Make the initial level once collisions are smoother.
