flat2d:
	-	Don't return EntityProperties from Entity as a reference, make it a pointer.
		Big re-write with alot of errors but easy fixes. (Not sure about this one, it looks wrong but I'm not
		sure if it's horribly wrong. You just need to remember to put & on variables that you assign the
		return to)
	-	Add ovveridable methods onVerticalCollision and onHorizontalCollision so that we can add entities that
		use them.

Game:
	x	Make the initial level(s) once collisions are smoother. (Collisions are smoother now)
	x	Fix paralax scrolling by adding a z parameter to entity

Additional thoughts:
	-	Some more powerups perhaps? Are we happy with what we have? All suggestions are good suggestions
	-	Think I need to play some more games to get better ideas for my game
