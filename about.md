Just Don't Die is a simple platformer game that I've been working on for some time now.
The grand future plan is to get it through [steam greenlight](https://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/) once
I'm happy with it.

The main gameplay is navigating through the obstacles in a level using various powerups and trying to avoid
getting killed. Respawns are quick and checkpoints are frequent. Super Mario or Super Meatboy is a good
comparison to the game at the moment.

The game is written in C++ using the [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org). I've created a framework called "flat" in
paralell to writing the game. It's included and compiled with the source. The plan is to reuse this for future
prototypes. I've had to put less and less work into "flat" lately and getting more and more into gamecode.

### Want to help?
I'm always open to contributions, test the game, make some sounds or music or write some code.
Whatever it is just send a pull request or a message and I will get back to you.
