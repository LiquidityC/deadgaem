Sooo... I started making maps for my program. Just figured out how hard that is. I don't want a bunch of text that the player is forced to read when he is playing the game. Rather I want him to learn by 'accident' which is not as simple as I thought.
That and my Gimp skills aren't the greatest. Makes me wish I had an artist that would work for me for free.

I guess I will get back to you with more info once I have some more info.

    var disqus_config = function () {
        this.page.url = '{{ site.url }}';
        this.page.identifier = '{{ page.url }}';
    };
    (function() {  // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
        var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
        
        s.src = '//linuxcodehacks.disqus.com/embed.js';
        
        s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
        (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
    })();
