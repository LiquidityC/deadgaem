Ok, here we go. I created this blog for my game mostly so I'd have
someone to tell about what I just did and what my plans are. Not that
anyone is reading it right now but still. If someone does it will look
pretty serious.  I also think it will help a lot with development if I
write down my ideas and plans. That way I get some free project notes
and documentation that I can look back on.

### Current status
I'm pretty happy with the flatlib. It's requiring very little updates
or code commits lately and my main focus has been able to stay on the
actual game code.  So far it's look like the game will be similar to
Super Mario and Super Meatboy. Just google those if you don't know what
they are. Although, if you don't know what Super Mario is, very little
in this blog should be interesting to you.

The game at least runs pretyt smoothly now. I made some optimizations to
the input handling so that all objects are no longer checked on input
events. Not sure if it helps much. Although it should, it might be a
good idea for me to put some time into debugging of the game. Creating
good outputs so that I can monitor what's going on in different
places. Benchmarking functions should probably be the first step.
