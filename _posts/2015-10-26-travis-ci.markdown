So, travisci's new update for building just uined my night. Code is fine, Travis just doesn't know it yet.

I'm tired and going to bed. Travis is great but it's hell getting it configured. Especiall since the ppa's for
SDL2 aren't whitelisted and neither is the libsdl2-mixer-dev package.
The ppa was already issued so I added my '+1' of power among the comments. The package I created an issue for.
Until both of these get through I guess my inbox will be spammed by travis stuff.

Goodnight...
