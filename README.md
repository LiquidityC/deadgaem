I'ts going to be a platform game. Just haven't gotten there quite yet.

Currently the game consists of controlling your little soldier through one map
avoiding the rockets and the spikes.
The soldier has a ghost mode that enables him to avoid some types of rockets but not others.

Used libraries:
- boost
- CppUTest
- Box2d (soon)
- SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer
