# Just DON'T die [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LiquidityC/deadgaem.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LiquidityC/deadgaem)

It's going to be a platform game. Just haven't gotten there quite yet.

Currently the game consists of controlling your little soldier through one map
avoiding the rockets and the spikes.
The soldier has a ghost mode that enables him to avoid some types of rockets but not others.
